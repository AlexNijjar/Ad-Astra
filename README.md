Ad Astra! (translation: "To the Stars!") is a space mod with a focus on technology, travel and exploration. We've got everything you need to become an astronaut: rockets, space suits, space stations and machines. Why not take a stroll on the Moon? Build a self-sustaining bunker on Mars? Go mining on Venus? The entire Solar System, better yet, Milky Way, is at your disposal!

Consider downloading REI or EMI for recipe viewing. Ad Astra! also has an in-game Patchouli guidebook called the "Astrodux," which will guide you through progression.
