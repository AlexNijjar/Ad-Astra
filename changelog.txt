Also, Ad Astra is now hosted on the Resourceful Bees maven. So if you're making an addon or want to include Ad Astra in your dev environment, you can now do so by adding the following to your build.gradle:
- common: modImplementation "earth.terrarium:ad_astra-common-$rootProject.minecraft_version:$rootProject.ad_astra_version"
- fabric: modImplementation "earth.terrarium:ad_astra-fabric-$rootProject.minecraft_version:$rootProject.ad_astra_version"
- forge: modImplementation "earth.terrarium:ad_astra-forge-$rootProject.minecraft_version:$rootProject.ad_astra_version"
